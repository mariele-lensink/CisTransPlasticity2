# CisTransPlasticity
Analyzing the Cis/Trans Regulation of Plasticity - eQTLs of Salicylic Acid Treatments

## Project Overview
Current analytical approaches studying the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental cues (hereby called plasticity) have a built in statistical bias for cis-regulatory elements (genomic features adjacent to gene of interest) and are underpowered to find trans-regulatory elements (genes and features unlinked to gene of interest but causal to the gene). Consequently, it is unclear if our current perception of genetic control of plasticity is accurate. Developing a more comprehensive and confident understanding of genetic control of plasticity will provide an alternative strategy to address how to control yield of important crops in fluctuating environments. To circumvent potential statistical bias, I am using transcriptomes from recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have no population structure and are biallelic. This project uses quantitationve trait loci analysis on this population treated with silwet and salicyclic acid to reveal genetic architecture underlying phenotypic plasticity and tests if the observed cis-regulatory bias is actually a statistical artifact.
